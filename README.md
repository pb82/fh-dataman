## Build

### Transpile

This service is written with ES6 and transpiled to ES5 using Babel. All the source code should be written in the `src` directory. Run

```bash
grunt babel
```

to transpile the code. The traspiled code will be written to the `lib` dir.


### Adding Unit Tests

Unit tests should be added to the same directory of the test target file. It should have a suffix wtih "_test.js". Tests should be written using ES6 syntax as well. To run all the tests:

```bash
grunt unit
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
grunt integration
```

In order to run the integration tests, you will need to have Mongodb (v2.x) running somewhere. There must be an admin user created in the `admin` Mongodb database, and it should have the full admin permission. You can then override the Mongodb settings via the following environment variables:

```bash
export MONGO_SERVER=192.168.33.10 #default to 'localhost'
export MONGO_ADMIN_USER=admin #default to 'admin'
export MONGO_ADMIN_PASS=password #default to 'admin'
```

#### Docker
If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed a Dockerfile is provided to initialise a MongoDB instance configured to run integrations tests against.

```bash
$ docker build -t dataman-mongo ./docker/test/
$ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 dataman-mongo
```

## Usage

To start the service, run

```bash
node ./lib/app.js ./config/dev.json
```

### Swagger API docs
If adding a new API to fh-dataman make sure to update the API docs.

fh-dataman is using [Swagger](http://swagger.io) for documentation.

fh-datamans' spec is located in the [api-docs/swagger.yaml](api-docs/swagger.yaml) file.

New API endpoints can be entered under the `paths` property.
